						1. Start by taking a first stab at writing your design challenge. It should be short and easy to remember, a single sentence that conveys what you want to do. We often phrase these as questions which set you and your team up to be solution-oriented and to generate lots of ideas along the way.
							-To create awareness on fashion sustainability and encourage the community take 			self-responsibility.
							<br><br/>
						2. Properly framed design challenges drive toward ultimate impact, allow for a variety of solutions, and take into account constraints and context. Now try articulating it again with those factors in mind.
							-To design a simple website for Responsibility in Fashion that attracts users who 			need awareness on fashion sustainability and motivate them to join the movement of 			change.
							<br><br/>
						3. Another common pitfall when scoping a design challenge is going either too narrow or too broad. A narrowly scoped challenge won’t offer enough room to explore creative solutions. And a broadly scoped challenge won’t give you any idea where to start.
							-To design a simple and user-friendly website for Responsibility in Fashion that 			creates awareness of fashion sustainability and motivates users to take the next step 			in responsibility.
							<br><br/>
						4. Now that you’ve run your challenge through these filters, do it again. It may seem repetitive, but the right question is key to arriving at a good solution. A quick test we often run on a design challenge is to see if we can come up with five possible solutions in just a few minutes. If so, you’re likely on the right track.
							-To design a user-friendly website for Responsibility in Fashion that attracts their 			target audience and motivates site viewers to join the movement towards sustainable 			fashion.

<br><br/>
						The Problem:
						Designing a more easy-to-understand website for Responsibility in Fashion.
<br><br/>
						The Design Question:
						How does Responsibility in Fashion website help create awareness about fashion sustainability and encourage visitors to get involved in the movement?
<br><br/>

						The Ultimate Impact:
						To increase the site visitors who join the movement of shopping ethically and turn away from fast fashion.
<br><br/>
						Possible Solutions:
						Simplify the website, create some negative space, attract viewers interested in clothing and trends (since these are most likely the ones shopping unethically), choose meaningful imagery, put most important information at the front of the webpage, leave viewers with a clear next step to take, create a strong brand for the non-profit.
<br><br/>
						Context and Constraints:
						The target audience of this non-profit are people who are not educated about fashion sustainability, who probably will not be searching for this website in the first place.
						<br><br/>

						Tweaking the Original Design Question:
						How does Responsibility in Fashion website attract their target audience and create awareness about fashion sustainability?</p>
