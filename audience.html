						<h1>Audience and Goals</h1>
						<header>
							<p class="info">Defining the target audience helps to create specific site goals for those people.</p>
						</header>
							<h3>Audience</h3>
						<p>After writing all of the direct and indirect audience of Responsibility in Fashion, I ended up organizing them into three main groups: need help, give help,
						and skeptics. Under the "Give Help" category, I organized it into three sub-groups: volunteer, corporate sponsorship, and donate. These three sub-groups
					are based off of the Responsibility in Fashion website under the "Get Involved" tab, which indicates three buttons for volunteer, corporate sponsorship,
				and donate. Under these groups I brainstormed the target audience that would take the next step in each of these categories.</p>
