Responsibility in Fashions mission statement is that they are “a nonprofit bringing together sustainable, conscious, ethical, circular, and eco fashion organizations and government programs toward the goal of energizing and bringing innovation to the growing movement toward clean, safe and ethical fashion. They seek to accomplish their mission through creating awareness about fast fashion and getting involved in events. Responsibility in Fashion is located both in New York City and Los Angelos.

Shop Responsibly:
The tagline “Demand drives supply”
There are four main points:
Shop responsibly-made brands
Avoid conventional cotton
Avoid conventional leather
Avoid conventional dry cleaning
<br><br/>
Get Involved:
There are buttons to “volunteer” and “talk to us about corporate sponsorship.” Both of these lead to an automatic email window pop-up. The other button is to “donate,” which leads to a PayPal link.
There is also a box to “subscribe to our newsletter.”
<br><br/>
The Ugly Truth About Fashion:
This section talks about the effects of fast fashion on water and air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, waste toxic chemical dumping, pesticide and herbicide overuse, poverty wages, hazardous working conditions, worker exploitation, pesticide poisoning, human trafficking, and child labor.
<br><br/>
The Chemicals in our Clothes:
Alkylphenols, phthalates, brominated and chlorinated flame retardants, azo dyes, organotin compounds, perflourinated chemicals, chlorobenzenes, chlorinated solvents, chlorophenols, short-chain chlorinated paraffins, and heavy metals such as cadmium, lead, mercury, and chromium 6.
Try to find recent innovations in your client's particular area. They could be technological, behavioral, or cultural.
1. Good on You is a mobil app that gives ethical ratings on the different clothing shops and brands, helping you make more ethical purchase decisions.
Take a look at other solutions in your area. Which ones worked? Which ones didn’t? Are there any that feel similar to what you might design? Any solutions that have inspired you to make one of your own?
<br><br/>
-I observed Remake, which is another non-profit dedicated to creating awareness on fashion sustainability, which I believe has a successful website solution. On the very front of the webpage is a large image which reads, “Together let’s change fashion” with a large “donate” button. Viewers can see at a first scan of the webpage what their mission is and what action step to take. The bar at the top is very clean and straightforward, helping viewers find exactly what they’re looking for without overwhelming them with information. The web design is simply but functional, and is also visually appealing and modern, which speaks to their millennial audience.
I also looked at Labour behind the Label. Their strong branding and clear action steps are some of what make this site successful. The website seems to follow a grid that keeps all information concise and organized. Images are meaningful and apply to the message they are trying to convey. Icons are used to send visual information.
Is there any market data that you can dig up that may be relevant in helping you solve the design challenge?
<br><br/>
-The desire for sustainability is also broadly similar across most age groups, suggesting a shift in the trend that has been historically associated with millennial (25-34) and Generation Z (18-24) consumers. 28% of consumers would stop buying clothes from a company if they find out it is not committed to the cause.
When it comes to fashion brands who say they are committed to sustainability, only 23% of consumers believe they have a generally good idea of what these brands mean when they claim to be sustainable.
Identifying truly sustainable brands can be difficult for many consumers. 45% of survey respondents say it is difficult to know which fashion companies are truly committed to sustainability.
